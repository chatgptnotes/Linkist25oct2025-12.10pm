### 3. Auto-Apply Founding Discount
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### Coupon Details:
- **Code**: `LINKISTFM`
- **Discount**: 50% (percentage-based)
- **Usage**: One per account
- **Expiry**: Managed via Admin Panel (system_settings table)

#### Implementation:
1. **Database Migration**: `supabase/migrations/010_add_voucher_user_tracking.sql`
   - Created LINKISTFM voucher automatically
   - Added user tracking to prevent multiple uses
   - Added function `has_user_used_voucher()`

2. **Checkout Auto-Apply**: `app/nfc/checkout/page.tsx`
   - Checks if user is founding member via `/api/auth/me`
   - Auto-applies LINKISTFM on page load
   - Validates voucher and displays discount amount
   - Does NOT show expiry date to users (only discount amount shown)

3. **Voucher Validation**: Already exists in `/api/vouchers/validate/route.ts`
   - Checks email-based usage
   - Enforces one-per-account limit

---

### 4. Account Definition & Validation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### One Account = Unique Email + Mobile Number

#### Database Changes:
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/009_add_founding_member_fields.sql`
- Added unique index on `phone_number` column
- Allows NULL values but no duplicates

#### Registration Validation:
- **File**: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- Checks for existing email (409 Conflict error)
- Checks for existing phone number (409 Conflict error)
- Clear error messages:
  - "An account with this email already exists"
  - "An account with this phone number already exists"

**Validation Timing**: At registration (prevents duplicate accounts)

---

### 5. Button Behavior & Responsiveness
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### Responsive Text → Icon Conversion

**Implementation**: `app/profiles/dashboard/page.tsx`
```tsx
<Plus className="h-5 w-5 md:mr-2" />
<span className="hidden md:inline">Create New Profile</span>
```

**Behavior**:
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Shows icon only
- **Desktop (≥ 768px)**: Shows icon + text
- Uses Tailwind's responsive utilities (`hidden md:inline`)
- No text wrapping on any screen size

**Applied To**:
- Dashboard action buttons
- Navigation buttons
- Can be extended to other buttons as needed
