# üîê Authentication & Database Fix - README

## üìå Quick Start

**Problem Fixed:** Registration flow, OTP linking, and logout permissions

**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Ready for testing

---

## üöÄ How to Apply This Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (CRITICAL!)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy entire content of: `supabase/migrations/007_fix_user_id_foreign_keys.sql`
3. Paste and **Execute**
4. Wait for success message: ‚úÖ Migration completed successfully!

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Kill any running dev server
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Registration Flow

1. Open: `http://localhost:3000/welcome-to-linkist`
2. Fill form and submit
3. Check console logs for success messages
4. Verify database entries (see testing guide)

### Step 4: Test Logout Flow

1. Click "Reject" button on welcome page
2. Should redirect to home without errors
3. Check browser console - no errors should appear

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `user_id` foreign keys to `email_otps`, `mobile_otps`, and `profiles` tables
- Changed `profiles.user_id` from TEXT to UUID
- Created foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Added indexes for better performance

### 2. Backend APIs
- Registration now creates both user + profile entries
- OTPs are properly linked to users via `user_id`
- Logout API no longer requires authentication
- Better error handling throughout

### 3. Frontend
- Welcome page "Reject" button now works properly
- Clears localStorage before logout
- Graceful error handling

## üß™ Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Migration executed successfully in Supabase
- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Can register a new user on welcome page
- [ ] User appears in both `users` and `profiles` tables
- [ ] `profiles.user_id` matches `users.id`
- [ ] Mobile OTP has `user_id` populated
- [ ] Can verify mobile number
- [ ] "Reject" button works without errors
- [ ] Logout clears all cookies and localStorage

---

## üîç Verify Database Changes

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check if user_id columns exist with correct type
SELECT
  table_name,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('email_otps', 'mobile_otps', 'profiles')
  AND column_name = 'user_id';

-- Should return 3 rows with UUID type

-- Check foreign key constraints
SELECT
  tc.table_name,
  tc.constraint_name,
  tc.constraint_type,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_name IN ('email_otps', 'mobile_otps', 'profiles')
  AND kcu.column_name = 'user_id';

-- Should return 3 rows showing FK constraints to users(id)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Migration is Safe:** Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks, safe to re-run
2. **Profile Creation:** Non-fatal - if it fails, user still gets created
3. **OTP user_id:** Can be NULL for guest users (pre-registration)
4. **Logout:** Now works without authentication (intentional design)

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails
**Fix:** Check if you have SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env file

### Issue: Profile not created
**Fix:** Check Supabase logs for actual error. User will still work.

### Issue: OTP has user_id = NULL
**Fix:** Expected for guests. After registration, subsequent OTPs will have user_id.

### Issue: Logout still requires auth
**Fix:** Clear browser cache, restart server, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
