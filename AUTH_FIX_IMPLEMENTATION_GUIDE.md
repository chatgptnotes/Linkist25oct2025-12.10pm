# Auth & Database Fix - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Fixed authentication flow and database schema issues where:
1. `profiles`, `email_otps`, and `mobile_otps` tables weren't properly linked to `users` table via `user_id`
2. User couldn't logout during registration flow on welcome page
3. No proper permission system for logout

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (CRITICAL - Run First!)

**File:** `supabase/migrations/007_fix_user_id_foreign_keys.sql`

**What it does:**
- Adds `user_id UUID` column to `email_otps` table with foreign key to `users(id)`
- Adds `user_id UUID` column to `mobile_otps` table with foreign key to `users(id)`
- Fixes `profiles.user_id` from TEXT to UUID with proper foreign key
- Creates performance indexes
- Updates RLS policies for better security

**How to run:**
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, copy-paste the entire migration file and execute
```

---

### 2. Backend Changes

#### a) **lib/supabase-otp-store.ts**
- Added `user_id?: string | null` to `EmailOTPRecord` interface
- Added `user_id?: string | null` to `MobileOTPRecord` interface
- Updated `set()` methods to store `user_id` with OTP records

#### b) **lib/supabase-user-store.ts**
- Added new method: `createOrUpdateProfile()` to create/update profiles with user_id link
- Auto-creates profile entry when user registers
- Handles both create and update scenarios

#### c) **app/api/user/profile/route.ts**
- After creating user in `users` table, now also creates entry in `profiles` table
- Links profile with `user_id` for proper relationship
- Non-fatal error handling (profile creation failure won't block registration)

#### d) **app/api/send-mobile-otp/route.ts**
- Looks up user by phone number before sending OTP
- Stores `user_id` with OTP record if user exists
- Falls back to `user_id: null` for guest users (before registration)

#### e) **app/api/send-otp/route.ts**
- Similar to mobile OTP - links user_id when creating email OTP records
- Works for both authenticated and guest users

#### f) **app/api/auth/logout/route.ts** (MAJOR FIX!)
- **Removed authentication requirement** - anyone can logout now
- Gracefully handles missing sessions
- Always clears cookies even if database deletion fails
- Clears both `session` and `userEmail` cookies
- Never blocks logout - returns success even on errors

---

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### **app/welcome-to-linkist/page.tsx**
- `handleReject()` now clears localStorage before calling logout API
- Clears: `userOnboarded`, `userProfile`, `session`
- Non-blocking logout API call (continues even if API fails)
- Always redirects to home page

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy entire content of: supabase/migrations/007_fix_user_id_foreign_keys.sql
-- Execute it

-- Verify:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('email_otps', 'mobile_otps', 'profiles')
AND column_name = 'user_id';

-- Should show user_id as UUID type in all 3 tables
```

### Step 2: Test Registration Flow

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open:** `http://localhost:3000/welcome-to-linkist`

3. **Fill form with:**
   - Country: India
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Mobile: 9876543210
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Accept terms checkbox

4. **Click "Agree & Continue"**

5. **Check Database:**
   ```sql
   -- Check users table
   SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, phone_number FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

   -- Check profiles table (should have matching user_id)
   SELECT id, user_id, email, first_name, last_name FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

   -- Verify user_id matches in both tables
   ```

### Step 3: Test Mobile OTP Flow

1. **After registration, you'll be redirected to verify mobile**

2. **Check mobile_otps table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, mobile, otp, verified, expires_at FROM mobile_otps ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **user_id should be populated (not NULL)**

4. **Enter OTP and verify**

5. **Check users table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT mobile_verified FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   -- Should be TRUE
   ```

### Step 4: Test Logout from Welcome Page

1. **Go back to:** `http://localhost:3000/welcome-to-linkist`

2. **Click "Reject" button**

3. **Should:**
   - Clear localStorage (check DevTools > Application > Local Storage)
   - Clear session cookies (check DevTools > Application > Cookies)
   - Redirect to home page
   - **NO ERRORS IN CONSOLE**

4. **Check server logs:**
   ```
   Should see:
   ✅ Logout completed - all cookies cleared
   ```

### Step 5: Test Email OTP Flow (Login)

1. **Register a user first** (as above)

2. **Go to login page**

3. **Enter email and request OTP**

4. **Check email_otps table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, email, otp, verified FROM email_otps WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

5. **user_id should be populated**

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

### Database Schema ✅
- [ ] `email_otps` table has `user_id UUID` column
- [ ] `mobile_otps` table has `user_id UUID` column
- [ ] `profiles` table has `user_id UUID` column (not TEXT)
- [ ] All three tables have foreign key constraints to `users(id)`
- [ ] Indexes created: `idx_email_otps_user_id`, `idx_mobile_otps_user_id`

### API Functionality ✅
- [ ] `/api/user/profile` creates both user AND profile entries
- [ ] `/api/send-mobile-otp` stores user_id with OTP
- [ ] `/api/send-otp` stores user_id with email OTP
- [ ] `/api/auth/logout` works WITHOUT authentication
- [ ] Logout clears all cookies and localStorage

### Frontend Behavior ✅
- [ ] Welcome page "Reject" button clears localStorage
- [ ] Welcome page "Reject" button calls logout API
- [ ] Welcome page "Reject" button redirects to home
- [ ] No console errors during logout flow

### Data Integrity ✅
- [ ] New user in `users` table gets matching `profiles` entry
- [ ] `profiles.user_id` matches `users.id`
- [ ] OTP records have proper `user_id` link
- [ ] Mobile verification updates `users.mobile_verified`

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Migration fails with "column already exists"
**Solution:** The migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks, so it's safe to re-run.

### Issue 2: Profile creation fails
**Solution:** This is non-fatal by design. Check Supabase logs for the actual error. The user will still be created in `users` table.

### Issue 3: OTP has user_id = NULL
**Solution:** This is expected for guest users (before registration). After they register, subsequent OTPs will have user_id.

### Issue 4: Logout still requires authentication
**Solution:** Clear your browser cache and restart dev server. The logout API now has NO auth checks.

## 📊 Database Relationships (After Fix)

```
users (id, email, phone_number, ...)
  ↓
  ├── profiles (id, user_id → users.id)
  ├── email_otps (id, user_id → users.id)
  └── mobile_otps (id, user_id → users.id)
```

---

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

After implementing all changes:

✅ User registration creates entries in both `users` and `profiles` tables
✅ OTP records are properly linked to users via `user_id`
✅ Mobile verification updates user's verification status
✅ Logout works from anywhere, anytime, no auth required
✅ Welcome page "Reject" button works smoothly
✅ Database maintains referential integrity with foreign keys
✅ Better security with updated RLS policies

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Restart your dev server:** `npm run dev`
3. **Test the complete flow** (registration → OTP → logout)
4. **Check database** to verify all relationships
5. **Deploy to production** when tests pass

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Why user_id can be NULL in OTP tables?
- Guest users (not yet registered) can request OTPs
- After registration, OTPs are linked with user_id
- This allows flexible pre-registration OTP flow

### Why logout doesn't require auth?
- Users should always be able to logout
- Improves UX - no permission errors
- Follows best practices for logout flows
- Security is maintained by clearing cookies

### Why non-fatal profile creation?
- User registration should never fail due to profile issues
- User table is the source of truth
- Profile can be created/fixed later
- Prevents blocking the user journey
